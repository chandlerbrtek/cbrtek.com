        I'm a software engineer with a passion for solving problems creatively and without
        over-complication. I've led a team of developers and several projects from fast MVP
        phases to production releases generating revenue. I also have extensive experience
        working in and modernizing complex legacy systems. I do my best work in Java and
        JavaScript utilizing React, but I'm not afraid of learning something new!
